   07-hangman - 5.06.2024 - small groups
         with both "mouse click" and "keyboard" events,
         with minimum of the listeners - using
                         event propagation

   08-NodeJS-SQL-Your-Theme - continue with your theme
                           in accordance to the cookbook02.
                           See exercises 1. and 2. below.
                           19.06.2024

   09-calculator - 16.06.2024 - build it with css GRID,
          use both "mouse click" and "keyboard" events,
          with minimum of the listeners - using
                         event propagation.
          It should perform the actions: +,-,*,/,%,power,
          root, factorial, translating number from binary 
          to decimal, from decimal to binary, from hexadecimal
          to decimal, from decimal to hexadecimal.
          Optionally: translating numbers from decimal to 
          roman and from roman to decimal.
          Optionally - more functions.
      This project will be evaluated for the themes of:
        "algorithms and advanced DOM".

   Optional Projects:
      - Canvas "Breakout Game"
      - "Endless Dangers" - see the description below
      - "Dreidel"
      - "Memory Game" - see the beginning files and 
          the example of how to flip card inside 
          the "projects/optional/memory-game" dir
      - "Math Practice" - Optional project of math-practice 
         with drops containing math exercises and 
         going down. 
         When the player types right answer, 
         the drop should stop or disappear or 
         make some other response. 
      - "One page site with smooth scrolling" - like YummyIsrael


1. Refactor your "Is it a prime number?" project into React app.

2. Only for those who want to train more React:
   Use Cookbook04 - of the TODO app and create your own 
   list (of jokes, movies, etc. that you're able to 
   cross out, to delete and to add) - don't make it more 
   complicated than TODO was, as we're going to make
   more complicate things anyway.

3. Recursion. Continue from the lesson:
Create showFibonacci function that creates the string 
comprised of the Fibonacci sequence elements till the given 
element number. For example, showFibonacci(2) should show
1,1
and showFibonacci(7) should show 
1,1,2,3,5,8,13

4. Recursion. Let's invent sequence almoust like Fibonacci,
but it's elements starting from the 4th will be sum of the
previous 3 elements. 
1,1,1,3,5,9,17,31,57,105,193 etc.

a) Create function sequence(n) that shows the n-th element of 
our sequence. 

b) Create function showSeq(n) that shows all the elements of 
the sequence till n-th element (including)

5. React Challenge: Perfect Gallery component
   - Should be comprised of small components of 1 figure/article/div/...
   - Should get data from an array of objects 
   - Should be responsive (use flex or grid ...)
   - Optional: amount of items on the page 
   - What happens when we click on one item:
      -- it is enlarged and what else?
      -- does it have arrows to move between the enlarged items?
      -- does it have button bar below it?
      -- is it modal?
      -- how it disappears? with "Esc"? with "x"?
   - Could be sorted?
   - Optional: automatic movement

6. React Challenge: Eratosthenos Sieve
For example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
-- Each number should be a component
-- Optionally: input of the max number 
-- Show the cross-overs of the numbers in real time:
   a) when the Sieve component mounts (useEffect)
   b) with buttons "Start" and "Stop"
      (not necessarily useEffect())

7. Optionally: convert more projects (like Nim, Binary Guessing,
   String Games - to React component) - you could use them
   in our future React project
